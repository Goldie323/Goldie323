I am Nate but I go by Goldie323 online

I like to code in python, java, c, c++, lua and graph based languages like scratch or microsoft makecode

I like to use my coding skills for problem solving or maybe making something that could solve a real world problem like needing a specialized calculator

I also love to make logic gate circuits like tic-tac-toe in logic gates or even a currently in the works brainfuck circuit that runs "assembled" brainfuck code and what I mean by that is each different brainfuck operation of which there are 8 get a number 0-7 and so all you do is go character by character and changing a character for it's number and you can run it through my circuit.
